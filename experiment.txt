The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one specific responsibility or purpose. Violating SRP occurs when a class has multiple, unrelated responsibilities, making it harder to maintain, test, and understand. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
What the Single Responsibility Principle Means:
One Reason to Change:
A class should have a single, well-defined purpose, and changes to that purpose should only affect that class. 
Avoid Mixing Responsibilities:
Different responsibilities should be separated into different classes or modules. 
Benefits of SRP:
Improved Maintainability: Easier to understand, debug, and modify code. 
Increased Testability: Easier to isolate and test individual responsibilities. 
Enhanced Code Quality: Leads to more organized, modular, and reusable code. 
Examples of Violations:
Large, Monolithic Classes:
.
A class that handles multiple unrelated tasks, such as data storage, formatting, and display. 
Classes with Numerous Dependencies:
.
A class that depends on many other classes, making it harder to understand and modify. 
Classes that Perform Unrelated Tasks:
.
A class that handles user registration, email sending, and authentication all in one place. 
How to Detect Violations:
Look for Large Classes: Classes with many fields, methods, or responsibilities may be violating SRP. 
Check for Unrelated Logic: If a class handles multiple unrelated tasks, it may be violating SRP. 
Consider Dependencies: Excessive dependencies between classes can indicate a violation. 
How to Fix Violations:
Extract Unrelated Responsibilities: Separate unrelated tasks into new classes or modules.
Use Design Patterns: Design patterns like Strategy or Factory can help separate responsibilities.
Refactor Code: Reorganize the code to align with the SRP.
